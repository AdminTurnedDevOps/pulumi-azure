# examples/scenarios/azure/webserver

This is a basic example of creating a webserver on Virtual Machine in Azure based on examples from Terraform https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_machine.html
This sample requires a configuration value of 'adminpassword' which needs to be set for the stack.
